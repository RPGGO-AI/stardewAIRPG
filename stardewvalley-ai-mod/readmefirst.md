# Quick Start

To run this AI mod, you will need to obtain a api key from RPGGO first. 

Following the instructions:
1. Go to https://rpggo.ai, and login with your google account or discord account
2. Click your avatar profile in the up right corner of the website. And from the popup menu, click the "Manage Your API Key".
3. Click the Copy button to get your api key. For this example, the API key could something like "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.e30.zfzrQCYS28EoKu9tAG1UuvjivPZYJ2m4pgtUvx9GGCk"
4. Open rpggo_config.json file in this folder, and fill your api key in the "apiKey" field(note, only change this filed), as below:

	```
	{
	  "gameId": "G2AHD9ENT",
	  "apiKey": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.e30.zfzrQCYS28EoKu9tAG1UuvjivPZYJ2m4pgtUvx9GGCk",  // Only change this line. And be sure to keep the "," in the end of the line
	  .......
	}
	```

5. Here you go. Start your Stardew Valley and enjoy the AI jouney!
